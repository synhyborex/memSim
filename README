This program supports fifo and lru algorithms, but not opt page replacement algorithm.

Based on your example addresses-correct.txt, I assume that the physical memory frame number is equivalent to
  the frame number (in this case the index in the physical memory vector) plus the offset.
  ie: a frame index of 0 plus an offset of 20 would print 20.
