This program supports all three page replacement algorithms. The optimal page replacement algorithm
looks ahead and determines what to replace in the TLB or page table, based on what will be not be used
for the longest amount of time.

Based on your example addresses2-correct.txt, I assume that the physical memory frame number is equivalent to
  the frame number (in this case the index in the physical memory vector).
  addresses-correct.txt had this value represented as the frame number plus the offset.
  (ie: a frame number of 0 plus an offset of 20 would print 20).
